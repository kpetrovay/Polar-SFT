# Polar-SFT

Polar-SFT GitHub repository.

The code in this repository solves the radial component of the magnetic 
flux transport equation (induction equation) on the solar surface in 
the 1D (axisymmetric) case, including a heuristic decay term -B_r/tau on 
the right hand side. Results are then analysed from the point of view of 
compliance with observational constraints on the spatiotemporal variation 
of the polar magnetic field, marking the allowed domain in parameter space.

This code was used to obtain the results published in

Petrovay K. and Talafha M.: 
Optimization of surface flux transport models for the solar 
polar magnetic field,
Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics (2019)

Further details regarding the code are in Polar-SFT.pdf.
